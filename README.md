# loteria-game
Simple Loteria game using Phaser3, the Phaser3-Parcel-Template https://github.com/ourcade/phaser3-parcel-template via supertommy at Ourcade, and JavaScript. 

Controls are UpArrow to deal, DownArrow to check for matches and check for winning condition. 

There is a long suggestions list for future iterations:
- Add landing/home page with options
  - Let player input name
  - Let input custom board, or reselect board
  - Let select number of other players
- Add pot with starting money, then track across multiple games
- Stop when someone hits a win condition
- Remove person who loses all money
- Animations for winner- text, maybe highlight how they won, etc.
- make special win condition
- Have player manually select/ move bottle cap to matches. If they miss the match, so be it.
- Multiplayer ability?
